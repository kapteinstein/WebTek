        <p> Daniel Bolstad lives and works in Trondheim, Norway.

          His multidisciplinary work is mainly focused on creating tableaus using
          film, photography and illustration, to explore questions of identity and reality.
          In these tableaus a surrealistic theatre plays out - one without a beginning or
          an end. One that opposes classical theatre by imposing no truth or objectivity.
          Here the viewer is encouraged to interpret the works themselves.
  
          He currently studies at the Norwegian School of Photography.</p>
