          <h2>1. Header</h2>
        </header>

      <p>A title, the author names, and date.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>2. Administrative Details</h2>
        </header>

      <p>The name of your client, and his or her position in the organization.</p>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>3. Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
        </header>

      <p>A summary paragraph to remind the reader about the purpose, goals, and
      audience of your website. Make it brief and succinct.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>4. Navigation Structure</h2>
        </header>

      <p>A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using the
      terminology learned in class and the notes on navigation structures. This
      is not a sketch of your navbar (or whatever), but instead a map or
      description of which pages connect to which other pages. (It sometimes
      better to describe a clique in words than to try to draw it.) The goal is
      to explain why the choice of a particular structure makes sense for your
      website.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>5. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
        </header>

        <p>A description of design decisions that are <strong>universal</strong>
        to your site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes),
        the color scheme (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.),
        navbar position in the page and its appearance, banner, footer, the
        social icons bar, or background images (if any of them is applicable).
        In addition to the textual description of these elements, you should
        include a mockup image of this generic page that has only these common
        elements and no other content. Finally, you should describe how these
        universal design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and its
        audience.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>6. Content</h2>
        </header>

      <p>This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will
      need to give a text description of the content of the page as well as an
      image of the mockup of the page. The text describes what goal(s) this page
      fulfills, and how design decisions specific to it contribute into
      fulfilling such goals. The reason why you should describe the content is
      that you might not have yet received the actual content from the client
      and in your mockup of the page you will be using fake text, fake images,
      etc. While the content can be fake, you should try to use meaningful
      headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally you should describe
      the design decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any).
      Here is an example:</p>

      <p><em>Images of e-board members are stored as thumbnails to reduce the
        loading time of the page. They appear in a grid format on the left side
        of the page. Each thumbnail is of size 150x150. When clicked, they will
        open as larger images (320x480) on the right side of the page,
        surrounded by text describing the member's duties and reasons for
        joining the org. The chosen thumbnail will have a surrounding border in
        gray color, to provide visual feedback to the user for the selected
        content.</em></p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>7. Minimum Requirements</h2>
        </header>

      <p> The website must include four distinct JavaScript applications (for
      example, rollovers effects on images or menus, user-defined functions,
        form validation, animations etc.). The four applications must all be
        different from each other. <strong>Clearly indicate how each of you will
          be fulfilling these minimum requirements.</strong> Please note that
        each of these items must be constructed entirely by you and not copied
        from external websites on the Web (though you can modify code from our
        class materials). Once you fulfill the minimum requirements with your
        own code, you are allowed to get code from the web (with source
        attribution) to incorporate certain advanced components (e.g. image
        galleries with transitions), but they will not count as part of the
        minimum requirements.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h2>8. Plan</h2>
        </header>

      <p>Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the
      site. Outline the tasks to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks,
      and who is responsible for them. Include a list of files and folders,
      which will help each partner link to files her partner has built. Include
      a complete list of everything you need to get from your client (text,
      pictures, sound, etc.) and when you expect to get them. To the greatest
      extent you can, try to have all of these things by the time your design is
      done, so that nothing will delay your coding.</p>
